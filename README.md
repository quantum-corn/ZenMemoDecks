## How It Started

When I started to learn **Japanese**, I figured I needed some **SRS (Spaced Repetition System)**. I did find some good options but they were at least partly behind a paywall, which I could not really afford, plus I wanted to tweak the available content to my preference. Then I came across [Mochi SRS app](https://mochi.cards).

The homepage convinced me that it was good but the lack of pre-built decks turned me away. But when I found no other option the power it offered pulled me in. I took some time to understand how to build decks and the process was pretty permissive and offered almost everything I needed and what is more is that it was free. Completely. It does have paid features but I could manage without them. **I really recommend [Mochi](https://mochi.cards) as a learner**.

At first I set out to create a basic set for \hiragana\ (hiragana) and \katakana\ (katakana). I created a template that included \kana\ (kana) and its pronunciation. I created csv of the same data and imported it on the template to create card sets. Then I wanted to have the \hiragana\ reference to the corresponding \katakana\ (katakana) and vice versa. So I had to pull out exports and manually give sensible id to each card replacing system generated values and that worked.

I find it important to mention that I read an [article](https://seanv.dev/posts/mochi-app-for-vocab) by [@veritasnz](github.com/veritasnz) that helped me get the job done faster.

> Oh and I used my other project [romaji2hiragana](github.com/quantum-corn/romaji2hiragana) to create files with those hiragana. Feel free to check it out.

## Inspiration For The Project

Back to the story, then I wanted to create a deck for radicals but this was more daunting because the references were a little more elaborate plus I needed to create more csv, so I started looking for an available dataset. That search led me to some great [resources](github.com/quantum-corn/ZenMemoDecks#Resources--Credits). Big cheers to each one of them. And that is how I realized that I could use it all to make a big fat (hopefully complete?) Japanese learning resource collection.

## What Is Inside?

- \hiragana\
- \katakana\
  
***

## How To Use It?

1. Get the Mochi app from [here](https://mochi.cards).
2. Find the `.mochi` files, download them. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can download just one or all of them at once. I'd suggest using `radicals.mochi`, `kanji.mochi`, `vocabulary.mochi` together.
3. Download the kana-sounds folder and copy the location of the folder and edit the `kana` template by replacing the `?location?` with your location.
4. > [!NOTE]
   > I haven't tested this part on mobile devices yet.
5. Import the `.mochi` files in the Mochi app.
6. Go study.

> [!NOTE]
> I haven't yet figured a way to consistently port the attachment files to android. So that is not ready yet.

## Resources & Credits

This project owes huge gratitude to everyone here.

- [kanjialive](kanjialive.com) - they have immensely deep resources for radical and kanji data in this [repo](github.com/kanjialive/kanji-data-media).
- [@janclarin](github.com/janclarin) for [the script to scrape off kana stroke order animation](https://gist.github.com/janclarin/80617de5073157dc3256a7f71f169595) off wikimedia.
- And to wikimedia for stroke order animations of [hiragana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Hiragana_stroke_order_(animated_image_set)) and [katakana](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Katakana_stroke_order_(animated_image_set))
- [Tae Kim's learning materials](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/) - see below.

## Japanese Learning Resources

Here is a list of japanese learning resources that I have used/use to learn japanese. I have consciously and inadvertently used what I learned from them. In order to credit them and to recommend anyone further and show my appreciation for their work I put them here.

- [Tae Kim's learning materials](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/) - I know I have used this twice. But that is just how great his work is. Almost every other resource out there that I have come across references him for a reason after all.
- [Kanji Study by Chase Colburn](https://kanjistudyapp.com/index.html)
- [Tofugu](tofugu.com)
- [Renshuu](renshuu.org)
